Lumens is (read: will be) a 2D strategic action game, with real-time ray-tracing and emergent AI - as well as a physics engine (supporting collision detection and resolution, particle, rigid and soft-body dynamics), and generated environments and audio - and is being developed as a final year college project.

The light-emitting protagonist navigates a pitch dark environment: home to roaming swarms of glowing predators which feed on light.  To advance through the environment, the protagonist enters a mutual struggle for survival with the swarms of predators: stealthily negotiating overwhelming numbers; anticipating their movements; ensuring they do not light up too many; and skirting the edges to draw away more manageable individuals.
The dark conceals the details of the environment and its other occupants, and the player is never sure of exactly what lies outside their protagonist's small pool of light – the unpredictable swarm can be an unpredictable and deceptive threat.

The game features:
	Artificial intelligence modelling collective, emergent flocking behaviour (Reynolds, 2001; Buckland, 2005)
	Convincing real-time light simulation, with rays, shadow-casting, reflection, refraction, caustics, and after-image, which will form the core of the visual effects
	Soft body physics, influencing light rays, and with collision-detection
	Procedurally-generated levels
	Interactive, emergent audio, generated by and enhancing the gameplay
	Variety of antagonists, abilities, and settings
	Support for multiple devices, with elegant solutions for smaller, touch-screen and re-orientable interfaces
	Persistence – saving and loading
	Web-accessible high scores and leaderboards

It aims to emphasise procedurally-generated features – effects, animations, physical simulations, behaviours, audio, and environments should all be largely algorithmically generated at run-time, and react to the user and the game.  Pre-defined resources are kept to a minimum, and the experience instead emerges from activity within the bounds of the game environment.
