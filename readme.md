Lumens is a strategic action game, with real-time ray-tracing and emergent AI; a physics engine supporting collision detection and resolution, particle and rigid body motion, and soft-body dynamics; and generated environments and audio.
Developed as a final year college project, it is an experimental web application targeting modern, WebGL-enabled browsers.

Currently, it exists as a technical base for the game, supporting the basic physics, AI, and real-time dynamic shadow-casting - a move to native platforms may be required to overcome some limitations of WebGL that have been reached.

You play as a light-emitting entity, navigating a pitch dark environment – home to swarms of glowing predators seeking out sources of light which they feed upon.
Use stealth, speed, and accuracy to outmanoeuvre the unpredictable swarms; stealthily lure away and pick off individuals without being discovered by overwhelming numbers.
Darkness conceals threats, traps and dead-ends; light betrays you to your hunters.

The game will feature, among other things:

    Real-time ray-traced light simulation on the GPU, with shadow-casting, reflection, refraction, caustics, and after-image, which will form the core of the visual effects

    Artificial intelligence modelling emergent flocking, and other behaviours

    Soft body physics

    Procedurally-generated levels

    Interactive, emergent audio, generated through and enhancing the gameplay

    Variety of antagonists, abilities, and environments

    Support for multiple devices, with elegant solutions for smaller, touch-screen and re-orientable interfaces

    Web-accessible leaderboards and environments

It aims to emphasise procedurally-generated features – effects, animations, physical simulations, behaviours, audio, and environments should all be largely algorithmically generated at run-time, and react to the user and the game.  Pre-defined resources are kept to a minimum, and the experience instead emerges from activity within the bounds of the game environment.
