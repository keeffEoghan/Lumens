MOVE THE WINDOW so you can see the instructions in the other window.

I compiled two versions of the project, 64 and 128 stand for the grid resolution.

The article demo is compiled from the source code that I started with (presented at the Game Development Conference of 1999 by Jos Stam from WaveFront).

The glut.dll file needs to be in the same folder as the exe or in your Windows\system32 directory.

This is running on the CPU using C++, the 3D rendering API being used is OpenGL with the Glut tool kit library (The Glut thing is not really necessary but its there for now).

Instructions of how to do stuff will be in a separate window when you run it.
